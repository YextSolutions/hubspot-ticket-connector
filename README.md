# Product Description & Purpose

Pull in your Service Hub tickets with Yext's new Hubspot Data Connector! Hubspot Service Hub is a platform for brands to manage their Customer Support interactions. With the addition of the Hubspot Service Hub data connector, you can pull in all of your tickets into your Knowledge Graph to be used in Yext products. Note: this connector does not pull in any engagements or responses to tickets.

The Hubspot Ticket Connector pulls in all the ticket and pipeline data you need, such as name, category, priority, created and modified dates, pipeline stage, and owner ID into Yext. Note: this connector does not pull in any engagements or responses to tickets. The connector is configured to run comprehensively on a daily cadence. 

This app creates a custom Hubspot Ticket entity type and 7 custom fields: 

- Create Date
- Last Modified Date 
- Owner ID 
- Pipeline 
- Pipeline Stage 
- Ticket Category
- Ticket Priority
